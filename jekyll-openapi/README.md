# Jekyll/OpenAPI

**Note:** This project is **not finished** and is under active development. Contributions welcome!

Jekyll/OpenAPI is an OpenAPI 3 documentation website generator built with Jekyll for use on GitHub Pages.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator that works seamlessly with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), whilst the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs. Put this all together and you get a fast, secure and highly customisable static website with free hosting for your API documentation.
